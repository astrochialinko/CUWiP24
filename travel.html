								<p><b>Undergraduate Participants:</b> We aim to make CUWiP accessible to everyone. <b>For undergraduate students, all meals, travel to/from the airport, lodging, and accommodations during the conference are organized and the costs are met by CUWiP.</b> You indicate your length of staying in the registration form. Travel to the conference is usually paid for by your home department. The point of contact for lodging, meals, and transportation is Cathi Duncan (email: <a target="_blank" href=mailto:cduncanf@arizona.edu>cduncanf@arizona.edu</a>, cell: <a target="_blank" href=tel:5209091346>520-909-1346</a>). Prior to your arrival you will be sent a detailed email with all the information you will need when you arrive. Emergency point of contact during the three days conference period are Shufang Su (email: <a target="_blank" href=mailto:shufang@arizona.edu>shufang@arizona.edu</a>, cell: <a target="_blank" href=tel:5202716934>520-271-6934</a>) and Cathi Duncan (email: <a target="_blank" href=mailto:cduncanf@arizona.edu>cduncanf@arizona.edu</a>, cell: <a target="_blank" href=tel:5209091346>520-909-1346</a>)</p>

						
								<p><b>Travel fund:</b> In cases where your own department, or other sources, can not cover the cost, there are funds available to support travel to CUWiP so no one has to miss out on CUWiP for financial reasons. In this case, please email cuwip@arizona.edu<mailto:cuwip@arizona.edu> before December 15th to request travel support from UArizona. Please email us your itinerary and estimated costs for the transportation. We will review the proposals and send you an email to confirm that your request will be supported, or to suggest changes to make the proposed transportation mechanism more suitable. Without that email confirming our acceptance of your plans, we will not be able to reimburse the incurred costs.</p>
								
								<p>When you make your purchase, if the final price is significantly different from the estimated cost you submitted, or if the total is above $300, you will need to email us, prior to purchasing the tickets to get authorization. Significant costs which are not pre-approved may not be reimbursed.</p>
								
								<p>Travel costs will typically be reimbursed after the conference. In order to process your reimbursement after the conference, we will need several things from you:
									<ul>
										<li>A letter from your department addressed to University of Arizona, stating they cannot pay for your travel (or can only cover your travel partially, whichever applies).</li>
										<li>If you are not US citizen or green card holder, please bring your I-94, Visa and passport with you to the conference and find us in the conference check-in desk.</li>
										<li>After we approve your travel reimburse, we will send you a W-9 form (with instructions) to fill out and collect your receipts (airline reservations, uber/taxi receipt needs to show your first name and last name, rental car paperwork, etc. If you are driving with your own car, you need to provide the beginning and ending odometer readings and a map of the route. If overnight lodging is needed, <a href="https://gao.az.gov/sites/default/files/5095%20Reimbursement%20Rates%20%20180820.pdf" target="_blank">state per diem rates</a> will be applied.). It might take about a month to process the reimburse after the conference ends.</li>
									</ul>
								Also, to save the cost, we ask that you coordinate with those from the same place as you, and, where possible, car pool or share transport to / from the airport.
								</p>
									
								<p><b>Other Participants:</b> For other participants, all meals and local transportation between airport and conference site will be covered by CUWiP. Please click <a href="travel.html#lodging">here</a> for lodging information.
