										<h1>Q: What is CUWiP?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>The APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day regional conferences for undergraduate physics majors. The 2022 conferences will be held January 21-23, 2022.</p>
										<p>The goal of APS CUWiP is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas. The national and local organizing committees of APS CUWiP strive to create a welcoming environment for all, including undergraduate women and gender minorities.</p>
										<p>The 2022 program at University of Arizona will include research talks, panel discussions about graduate school and careers in physics, workshops and discussions about women in physics, student research talks and poster sessions, and laboratory tours.</p>

										<header class="style1"><h2>Applying & Registration</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: Who can attend? Do I need to be a physics major to apply?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>It is very important to complete all parts of the application and to write a thoughtful Applicant Statement. If conferences are oversubscribed, priority will be given to applicants who:
										<ol>
											<li>Are undergraduate physics or engineering physics majors.</li>
											<li>Have never attended an APS CUWiP.</li>
										</ol>
										</p>
										<p>For registration process for non-undergraduate students and interested faculty/mentors, please directly refer to the <a href="application.html#registration">Registration</a>.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What’s the difference between "application" and "registration"?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>You <b>apply</b> to attend CUWiP, the CUWiP leadership directs you to a site, the site reviews your application and you are accepted, wait-listed or declined according to the priorities listed above. Application is free, and the deadline is <b>Monday, October 4th, 2021 at 5pm ET.</b></p>
										<p>After you have been accepted, you will <b>register</b> for your accepted site to confirm that you will actually be attending, and provide specifics, such as special accomodations and dietary restrictions. There is a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference. The conference provides all lodging and meals. If necessary, the registration fee can be waived. To request a fee waiver, please contact <a href="mailto:women@aps.org" target="_blak">women@aps.org</a>.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: Why can I not apply to a specific site?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>As CUWiP is so popular, we need to carefully balance the loads across the sites to minimize travel costs and maximize the number of students who can attend CUWiP. Please do not book travel until you receive an acceptance email from, and complete registration for, a specific site.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: Do I need to book my travel before registering?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>No, but you should have an estimate of the cost. If you are traveling by air, or long distance train or bus, and your travel cost is not covered by your department, you can apply for <a href="travel.html#travel">travel fund</a> and your travel agenda and cost must be approved by the conference site organizers before you book your travel. Email us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:cuwip@arizona.edu">cuwip@arizona.edu</a> for approval. Due to the limited nature of our travel funds, we ask that you find the most economical means of transportation to and from the conference. For example, reach out to others in your department and see if carpooling is an option.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What will increase my chances of being accepted to the conference?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>First, make sure you submit your application by the deadline, Monday, October 4th, 2021 at 5pm ET.<p>
										<p>Second, make sure you put some thought into why you want to attend and what you want to get out of the conference. Please answer all questions on the application fully and honestly. Offering to present a talk or a poster, or indicating interest in travel support, will not affect your chances of being selected to attend.</p>
										</details>	

									</div>

									<div id="cost">
										
										<header class="style1"><h2>Cost & Funding</h2></header>

										<h1>Q: How much does the conference cost?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>Students who are accepted to attend the conference must pay a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals. Lodging (for non-local students) and food will be covered by the conference; you do not need to pay for your hotel room or food at the conference. We expect that your travel expenses will be covered by your home department or college. However, if they are not able to cover these expenses, travel funding is available, please email <a target="_blank" href="mailto:cuwip@arizona.edu">cuwip@arizona.edu</a> to learn more.</p>
										<p>If you cannot afford the registration fee and your department/college is unable to help, you may request a fee waiver by emailing <a href="mailto:women@aps.org" target="_blak">women@aps.org</a> for the appropriate form. The request takes approximately 48 hours to review. You must request a fee waiver before registering. <b>The deadline to request a fee waiver is on Wednesday, November 10, 2021 at 5:00 PM ET for initially accepted students and Wednesday, December 1, 2021 at 5:00pm ET for formally wait-listed, second round accepted students.</b> Please do not wait until the last minute to request the waiver and/or to register. For more information on fee waivers, contact <a href="mailto:women@aps.org" target="_blak">women@aps.org</a>.</p>

										<p>Please contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:cuwip@arizona.edu">cuwip@arizona.edu</a> to discuss your needs.</p>
										</details>	

										<h1>Q: What are pronouns?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>
										<p>The pronoun that a person chooses to use for themselves. For example: If Xena's preferred pronouns are she, her, and hers, you could say "Xena ate her food because she was hungry." She, her, hers and he, him, his are common examples of pronouns. Some people call these "female/feminine" and "male/masculine" pronouns, but many avoid these labels because, for example, not everyone who uses he feels like a "male" or "masculine."</p>

										<p>There are also lots of gender-neutral pronouns in use. Here are a few you might hear:
										<ul>
											<li>They, them, theirs (Xena ate their food because they were hungry.) This is a pretty common gender-neutral pronoun.... And yes, it can in fact be used in the singular.</li>
											<li>Ze, hir (Xena ate hir food because ze was hungry.) Ze is pronounced like "zee" can also be spelled zie or xe, and replaces she/he/they. Hir is pronounced like "here" and replaces her/hers/him/his/they/theirs.</li>
											<li>Just my name please! (Xena ate Xena's food because Xena was hungry) Some people prefer not to use pronouns at all, using their name as a pronoun instead.</li>
										</ul>
										</p>

										<p>Never, ever refer to a person as “it” or “he-she” (unless they specifically ask you to.) These are often used as offensive slurs. Based on the information <a target="_blank" href="https://www.samuelmerritt.edu/pride/gender#What">here</a> and resources linked therein.</p>
										</details>	


										<h1>Q: Why does CUWiP ask for my preferred pronouns? Why should I consider putting them on my name badge?</h1>
										<details><summary>Click here for answer...</summary>		
										<p>CUWiP seeks to be a safe space for all participants. By asking for preferred pronouns, we are ensuring that we don’t accidentally misgender any of our participants or make harmful assumptions based on appearance. Even if you have never considered this in relation to yourself, by including your preferred pronouns on your name badge you can help to make other CUWiP participants comfortable. We hope you will consider this.</p>
