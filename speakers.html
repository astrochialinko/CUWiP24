              <p>
                Jocelyn Bell Burnell inadvertently discovered pulsars as a
                graduate student in radio astronomy in Cambridge, opening up a
                new branch of astrophysics, work recognised by the award of a
                Nobel Prize to her supervisor. She has subsequently worked in
                many roles in many branches of astronomy, working part-time
                while raising a family. She is now a visiting academic in Oxford
                and the chancellor of the University of Dundee, Scotland. She
                has been president of the UK’s Royal Astronomical Society, in
                2008 became the first female president of the Institute of
                Physics for the UK and Ireland, and in 2014 the first female
                president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. She was one of the
                small group of women scientists that set up the Athena SWAN
                scheme. She has received many honors, including a $3 million
                Breakthrough Prize in 2018. The public appreciation and
                understanding of science have always been important to her, and
                she is much in demand as a speaker and broadcaster. In her spare
                time, she gardens, listens to choral music, and is active in the
                Quakers. She has co-edited an anthology of poetry with an
                astronomical theme, Dark Matter; Poems of Space.

              <br />
              <p>
                Marcia J. Rieke is a Professor of Astronomy at the University of
                Arizona, and is the principal investigator for the near-infrared
                camera (NIRCam) on the James Webb Space Telescope.Rieke's
                research interests include infrared observations of the center
                of the Milky Way and of other galactic nuclei. She has served as
                the deputy principal investigator on the Near Infrared Camera
                and Multi-Object Spectrometer for the Hubble Space Telescope
                (NICMOS), and the outreach coordinator for the Spitzer Space
                Telescope. Rieke came to the University of Arizona (UA) in 1976
                and has made seminal contributions to infrared astronomy. Her
                contributions to astronomical research, to instrument
                development and to service to the astronomical community in
                public policy and outreach are recognized internationally. She
                also has been active in using Arizona's ground-based telescopes
                and a member of the UA College of Science's Galileo Circle
                Fellows. Marcia Rieke was born in Michigan, where the presence
                of Dow Chemicals headquarters made science a topic of interest
                for kids throughout the school system. Rieke received her
                undergraduate and graduate degrees in physics from the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Mass. She was
                elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
                joining the ranks of former vice presidents and Supreme Court
                justices, Nobel and Academy Award winners and prominent
                executives.

              <p>
                Rebecca Lipson earned a B.A in biology from Gustavus Adolphus
                College. She feels very fortunate to have had access to doing
                research as an undergrad, studying ecology in the forests of
                Minnesota. After a variety of post-baccalaureate life
                experiences, Rebecca found her calling in education, spending 8
                years teaching middle school science, math, and special
                education in Tucson’s public schools. Before joining the Office
                of Societal Impact, Rebecca helped launch and grow UA Sky School
                as the Assistant Director of Education from 2013 to 2021. Having
                seen the positive impacts of engaging K-12 students in
                scientific inquiry and research, Rebecca is motivated to create
                accessible and equitable opportunities for UAZ students, both in
                and beyond the classroom via research, internships, mentorship,
                and personal growth. Her role in Societal Impact allows her to
                work on undergraduate research initiatives and the TIMESTEP
                program, which supports undergraduate success and retention
                primarily for astronomy and physics majors at UAZ. When not in
                front of a computer or in a classroom, Rebecca can be found
                gardening, hiking, camping, and just generally enjoying the
                outdoors with her family.

                Dr. Christine O'Donnell is passionate about investigating how
                the Universe works and sharing that knowledge with others. She
                is currently an Education & Diversity Program Manager at the
                American Physical Society (APS), the largest professional
                society for physicists in the US. Prior to her work with APS,
                she was involed in education research, with a focus on equity
                and inclusion in science education. She created and implemented
                culturally responsive science curriculum and associated
                professional/instructor development in order to empower students
                to be able to engage with and critique science (including both
                content and cultural norms) to improve society.

                As a leader of the Women in Physics group she has helped
                organize and attended a lot of workshops on intrinsic bias,
                racism, sexism, imposter syndrome, career planning, etc and
                after she took the AGL mentorship course she gave an abbreviated

                Boulder she have served on student groups and grad life panels
                probably half a dozen times.

                Gender stereotypes and biases have been persistent challenges in
                academia, affecting the experiences and opportunities of women
                researchers. In the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), these
                biases can be further exaggerated and amplified, perpetuating
                the underrepresentation of women in scientific fields. This
                workshop, designed for undergraduate female students, aims to
                shed light on the biases against women researchers and explore
                how AI technologies can inadvertently perpetuate and reinforce
                these stereotypes.

              <p>
                Renee Michelle Goertzen is the Assistant Director for the APS
                Programs department, where she manages projects related to
                education and diversity. She has a physics PhD from the
                University of Maryland College Park. Her previous research was
                in the field of physics education research, focusing on
                professional development and physics student identity. She has
                worked for the American Physical Society, managing programs
                related to physics teachers, Since 2019, she has been the
                director of CUWiP. Her first degree is in German Literature and
                then she worked as a chef for a while, so she strongly believes
                that it is never too late in life to discover physics and make
                it your career. In addition, she is always ready to talk to
                people about her passions - Star Trek, non-academic careers in
                physics, DIY plumbing, and not-very-fast bicycling.
