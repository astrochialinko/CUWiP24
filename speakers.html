								<h6>Prof. Donna Strickland</h6>
								<em>Professor, University of Waterloo</em>
								<h1>Keynote Speaker (Saturday, 12:00-13:30)</h1>
								<p>Donna Strickland is a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo and is one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2018 for developing chirped pulse amplification with Gérard Mourou, her PhD supervisor at the time. They published this Nobel-winning research in 1985 when Strickland was a PhD student at the University of Rochester.
								Strickland earned a B.Eng. from McMaster University and a PhD in optics from the University of Rochester. Strickland was a research associate at the National Research Council Canada, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a member of technical staff at Princeton University. In 1997, she joined the University of Waterloo, where her ultrafast laser group develops high-intensity laser systems for nonlinear optics investigations.
								Strickland served as the president of the Optical Society (OSA) in 2013 and is a fellow of OSA, SPIE, the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Society. She is an honorary fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Physics and an international member of the US National Academy of Science. Strickland was named a Companion of the Order of Canada.

								<h6>Dr. Renee Michelle Goertzen</h6>
								<em>APS Representative, Assistant Director for the APS Programs Department, Director of CUWiP</em>
								<h1> Welcome Remarks (Friday, 18:00)</h1>
								<p>Renee Michelle Goertzen is the Assistant Director for the APS Programs department, where she manages projects related to education and diversity. She has a physics PhD from the University of Maryland College Park. Her previous research was in the field of physics education research, focusing on professional development and physics student identity. She has worked for the American Physical Society, managing programs related to physics teachers, Since 2019, she has been the director of CUWiP.  Her first degree is in German Literature and then she worked as a chef for a while, so she strongly believes that it is never too late in life to discover physics and make it your career. In addition, she is always ready to talk to people about her passions - Star Trek, non-academic careers in physics, DIY plumbing, and not-very-fast bicycling.

								<em>Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Michigan</em>
								<h1>After-dinner speaker (Friday, 19:30-20:00)</h1>
								<p>Dr. Kaitlin Rasmussen is a queer, non-binary astrophysicist and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan. She obtained her B. S. in Astrophysics from Florida State University in 2015 and her Ph.D. in Physics from University of Notre Dame in 2020. Dr. Rasmussen studies the atmospheres of exoplanets and is the PI of an international effort to find and study the oldest planets in the galaxy. She is also the leading author of the Astro 2020 Decadal white paper, “The Non-Binary Fraction: Looking Toward the Future of Gender Equity in Astronomy”, a trans and non-binary perspective on improving the field with a focus on improving the self-assessment of gender disparities. Dr. Rasmussen is active on twitter as @toomanyspectra and writes queer science fiction under the pseudonym C. M. Fields.

								<h6>Prof. Kathryne Daniel</h6>
								<em>Assistant Professor, Bryn Mawr College & Inaugural Distinguished Vera Rubin Visiting Professor, UC-Santa Cruz</em>
								<h1>Plenary Talk 1 - Physics (Saturday, 08:45-09:30)</h1>
								<p>Professor Kathryne J Daniel is a theoretical astrophysicist whose research focuses on stellar dynamics and understanding how spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, evolve through internal, gravitational processes.Her work provides a foundation for understanding the physical drivers behind observational trends.She is a professor in the Physics Department at Bryn Mawr College (BMC), an historically women’s college, and the Inaugural Distinguished Vera Rubin Visiting Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. received her A.B. from BMC in Classical & Near Eastern Archaeology and Physics and she earned her PhD in Physics & Astronomy from Johns Hopkins University. <br /> 
								Daniel has received several awards throughout her career in recognition of her scientific contributions including being selected as a Scialog Fellow (Research Corp & Heising-Simons Foundation), a NSF Graduate Research Fellow (GRFP), and an American Dissertation Fellow for the American Association of University Women (AAUW).<br /> 
								Professor Daniel’s identity and perspective from the margins as a LGBTQ+ woman of Chickasaw and Comanche heritage informs her scientific approach, teaching methods, and mode of engagement with community.She is a member of the Society for Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), served on the AAS Committee on the Status of Minorities in Astronomy (CSMA), and organizes and hosts workshops combating identity based discrimination in STEM.Professor Daniel served on the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) decadal review of the profession (Astro2020) on the panel for the State of the Profession and Societal Impacts (Appendix N). In the last year, Daniel is particularly proud to have co-founded the Society of Indigenous Physicists (SIP).
